  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Io sono Pietro. I was born at the turn of the century, tucked between the Rabbit and the Dragon, a Faenza, fra tutti i posti; una delle piccole citt√† italiane pi√π noiose che potete immaginarvi. Non mi credete? Beh, non me ne frega un cazzo. Sono stato addestrato accademicamente nelle arti visive da quand'avevo tredici anni, proseguendo i miei studi universitari all'Accdemia di Belle arti di Bologna sotto la tutela di Luca Bertolo. L'accademia era uno scherzo.
Divertente, ammetto, ma gli scherzi non dovrebbero avere rette d'iscrizioni, no? For this and a platitude of other reasons, I decided to leave Italy and continue my studies in England, ending up in Newcastle upon Tyne. How did that happen? I'm not sure either but I don't regret it. Still, it wasn't the place for me. I applied to Camberwell College of Arts and got in, finishing my BA there with a first class honours.
Camberwell aveva i suoi grossi problemi, ma dopo aver cambiato istituto tre volte decisi di chetarmi e di star zitto (joking, I can't do that). Right after my BA, I got into Central Saint Martins, initially in the MA Photography and Philosophy, but then I switched to MAFA. The take of my adventure at CSM should not be divulged to whoever happens on the web; I'm not your cape crusader.
Buy me a drink IRL, though, and I'll spill the tea. I'll spill it all on your fancy shoes and you'll kindly thank me for my time.
But this is the past and the present that is soon to be past. The future? Who knows. Guess I'll just keep making art.
This site is a collection of my projects and visual thoughts, albeit scattered.</p>

  <h2>Manifesto</h2>
   <p>I truly loathe the futility of talking about my art, so I'll let my mind go as abstract as it wishes. The joke is on you all as much as it is on me.
Perhaps the most effective introduction to my art and maybe even to myself, which I realised not long ago, is to state that I have felt gaps within reality for as long as I can remember.
People around me always seemed to possess pieces of a puzzle which I did not even know were there; as though they were aware and familiar with certain facets of being alive that had eluded me, and to this day, I struggle to grasp within my reach as though they were more complete than I could even fathom to understand; so widespread were these pieces of information that I was left feeling somewhat defective, living in stasis at the bottom of a vast body of murky water. 
From there, godless, isolated, stupid, and crooked, I consciously and subconsciously use artmaking to try to explain and process reality, repeating those ancient human acts of storytelling and theorising to make sense of the world. I tell fairytales. I hypothesise theories.
I am designing cosmogonies. 
As such, my art is shaped by two forces pulling in opposite directions: a desire to create and a desire to destroy. The rapture between these two polarities generates fertile ground on which I feel I can walk further and further into life, towards freedom, whatever that may be.
I want more than just to survive or live; I want to thrive! Art's functions in this quest will be of aid and of testimony: each piece reminds me that I am trying to move somewhere.
The sound of awe is the coming of Heaven on Earth, with no limitations. It was written on a Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses‚Äô pamphlet so it ought to be true they wouldn‚Äôt lie to me.
I want it.</p>

  <p>Thank you for being here, I guess.</p>
