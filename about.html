  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Io sono Pietro.
    I was born at the turn of the century, swaying between the Rabbit and the Dragon, <span lang="it">a Faenza, fra tutti i posti; una delle piccole cittÃ  italiane piÃ¹ noiose che potete immaginarvi. Non mi credete? Beh, non me ne frega un cazzo.</span><br>
    <span lang="it">Sono stato addestrato accademicamente nelle arti visive da quand'avevo tredici anni, proseguendo i miei studi universitari all'Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna sotto la tutela di Luca Bertolo. L'accademia era uno scherzo.</span><br>
    <span lang="it">Divertente, ammetto, ma gli scherzi non dovrebbero avere rette d'iscrizioni, no?</span> For this, and a platitude of other reasons, I decided to leave Italy and pursue a higher education in England, ending up in Newcastle upon Tyne. How did that happen? I'm not sure either but I don't regret it. Still, it wasn't the place for me.<br>
    I applied to Camberwell College of Arts and got in, finishing my BA there with first class honours.<br>
    <span lang="it">Camberwell aveva i suoi grossi problemi, ma dopo aver cambiato istituto tre volte decisi di chetarmi e di star zitto</span> (joking, I can't do that). Right after my BA, I got into Central Saint Martins, initially in the MA Photography and Philosophy, but then I switched to MAFA. The Odissey that has been my time at CSM should not be divulged to whoever you think you are, here, on the web; I'm not your cape crusader.<br>
    Buy me a drink IRL, though, and I'll spill the tea. I'll spill it all on your fancy shoes and you'll kindly thank me for my time.<br>
    But this is the past and the present that is soon to be past. The future? Who knows. I'll just keep making art.<br>
    This site is a collection of my projects and visual thoughts, albeit scattered.

  <h2>Manifesto</h2>
  <p>
<p>Iâ€™m looking for a miracle.</p>

<p>Roars of thunder and flashes of light scorch the earth in search of fertile soil; I'm drooling. I wonder what flavour is yet to come<br>
I hope itâ€™s chocolaty even though I say I donâ€™t like it that much.</p>

<p>Lines are forming between the dots, like ancient constellations you point your index at, and I'll pretend to know about them all already.<br>
Have people long gone gazed at similar inward skies?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m looking for a miracle.</p>

<p>I was promised a miracle, and Iâ€™ve waited for it to appear in any form, shape, wave, or noise. The sound of awe is the coming of Heaven on Earth, with no limitations. It was written on a Jehovahâ€™s Witnessesâ€™ pamphlet so it ought to be true<br>
they wouldnâ€™t lie to me. I want it.</p>

<p>I realised not long ago that I have felt gaps within reality for as long as I can remember.<br>
People around me always seemed to possess pieces of a puzzle which I did not even know were there; as though they were aware and familiar with certain facets of being alive that had eluded me, and to this day, I struggle to grasp within my reach as though they were more complete than I could even fathom to understand; so widespread were these pieces of information that I was left feeling somewhat defective, living in stasis at the bottom of a vast body of murky water.<br>
From there, godless, isolated, stupid, and crooked, I use artmaking to process and interact with reality, repeating those ancient human acts of storytelling and theorising to make sense of the world.<br>
This form of communication is powerful and terrifying.<br>
To guard myself, I encode my memories, thoughts, emotions, desires and traumas using the language of fairy tales, fables, and dreams.<br>
I'm designing cosmogonies.<br>
As such, anything I do is shaped by two forces pulling in opposite directions: a desire to create and a desire to destroy. The rapture between these two polarities generates fertile ground on which I feel I can walk further and further into life, towards freedom, whatever that may be.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m looking for a miracle.</p>

<p>I was promised a miracle, and Iâ€™ve waited for it to appear in front of me. But I waited a long time; I waited in an unnatural stasis. A consuming stillness. As I awaited, it began to dawn on me that perhaps the miracle would not come. Perhaps, I am going to have to trigger a miracle. Maybe, I will have to design my miracle, and thereâ€™s a chance I might have to become my own miracle.<br>
This doesn't have to make sense to you, but to me, it was the coming of Heaven on Earth with no limitations.<br>
Time to break the stillness.<br>
Time to move my ass. Time to claim this body I didnâ€™t know I had, and to make the air move around it as I walk.<br>
Time to notice that each word I cast ricochets onto a surface. Time to build a palace with bricks that are sentences, that are visions.<br>
No more excuses.</p>

<p>(Sternly, me to myself only) Be the miracle.</p>
  </p>

  <p>Thank you for being here, I guess.</p>
